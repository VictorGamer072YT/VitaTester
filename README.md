# VitaTester

A simple homebrew for testing the input data on the PSVita

Currently only displays 'basic' information, that is:
- Vita input (i.e. nothing that is only in a DS3/DS4 will not be tested, L3/R3, or L2/R2; may add support later)
- Touch (both front and back)

Support for DS3/DS4 will (probably) be added later.

Other ideas:
- Motion preview (with the controller model moving?)
- Audio test
- Show the color of the PS Button
- Show if headphone is plugged in (requires system privileges)
- Show the colour of the lightbar in the DS4 (Can you even get the colour?)
- Show the player id (assuming DS3/DS4)
- Test the rumble motors in the DS3/DS4 (Slider for the right (heavy) motor, button for the left (light) motor)
- Show if the Volume Up/Down buttons are pressed (system privileges)
